For instance, if you are really inhaling a lot more through\n#one nostril than the other, and you are subtracting the individual difference of the between nostril test from the TMA alone, you \n#should subtract the difference from the average of the TMA alone rating in the right nostril from both in different nostrils but where the TMA is in the right nostril\n#that way it is a comparable level of TMA...\n#would this truely solve the issue? maybe talk to Joel about whether its worth analyzing this way...\n",
